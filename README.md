# Discord-Destroyer

Destroys the Discord guild of your choice.

## Setup Guide

**MAKE SURE YOU HAVE NODE.JS BEFORE USING THIS!!!**


Open index.js in the editor of your choice (preferibly notepad++ or an IDE). Modify the values specified in the settings object. Save the file. Add the bot to the guild of choice. Then execute the bot using ``node index``. Watch the guild burn. ðŸ”¥

## Credits

The idea was sourced from [Technach](https://github.com/technach), I decided it was ok to reporoduced it due to it's genericness, because this is literally the only way you could do it anyway. 

## Accountability &amp; Disclaimer
